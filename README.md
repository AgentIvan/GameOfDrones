Game of Drones
============

The challenge Game of Drones is a battle of artificial intelligences organized by [Parrot](http://www.parrot.com) and [Codingame](http://www.codingame.com), which ran from 14 to 25 March 2014.

The game is to control zones on a rectangular platform. You own a fleet of drones (so do your enemies) and you take the control of a zone if you have more drones on this zone that any enemy (there are 2 to 4 players in a game).

You decide each game turn which direction you want to send your drones in, and you earn 1 point per zone you control at the end of the turn. After 200 turns, the player with the highest score wins.

You will find here the source code of my AI, ranked 12th out of 621 competitors at the end of the challenge. You can see the the final ranking [here](http://www.codingame.com/cg/#!ranking:parrot).
